Telegram bot and Windows scripts to automatically print text messages in Telegram on an IBM SureMark receipt printer.
This version of the SureMark 4610 unfortunately only has USB and a proprietary protocol, so it doesn't work natively on Linux. Therefore, the only way to get it to print anything is using some windows 16-bit executable.

I had an old crappy Windows Tablet lying around collecting dust, so I repurposed it.

Now it's a crappy tablet printing Word 2007 documents via Telegram Running Windows XP in Virtualbox on Arch Linux!

## Basic Setup

Linux machine running Windows XP (32 bit) in a VM, with a shared folder (`Z:\` in Windows).

The Python telegram bot runs on Linux.
Whenever the user sends a text message, it creates a file `to_printN.extension` in a shared folder.

The batch script `print_contents.bat` polls the folder every 500ms.
If it encounters `to_printN.{doc(x), txt, bmp}`, it starts Microsoft Word 2007 using a specific macro (`macro.vba`).

The macro reads the `to_print*` file and opens it or appends it to `empty_receipt.doc`.
The macro then prints the document, suppressing any errors or warnings (about margins).
Lastly it deletes the file and terminates Word.

The script `macro.vba` is embedded in the base template of the Microsoft Office installation, so the file is not explicitly present on the system.

## Features
* Temporarily disable printing, using the `/sleep` command
* Manage list of blocked and allowed users from telegram, as admin.
* Print unicode text. Including EMOJI üëÅüëÖüëÅ!!
* Print images (with captions), automatically converted to black and white bitmaps.
* Print Microsoft Office `.doc` and `.docx` files.
* Request a template Microsoft Office `.doc` file with the correct paper size.
* Get notified when you receive a fax.
* Supports faxing stickers (remapping transparency to white)
* Print superfast using a resident font, using the \<F\> html-style tag
* Print numbers as EAN-13 barcode using the \<BAR\> tag
* Pipe any output from your terminal to the printer with `mark`!
* Print png files without compression, ideal for extreme aspect ratios!
* Using [Willus' excellent pdf reflower](https://www.willus.com/k2pdfopt/) you can print any pdf, such as scientific publications. Just do `k2pdfopt input.pdf -w 400 -h 1620 -dpi 167 -idpi -2 && pdftoppm input_k2opt.pdf -r 250 out -png` and then send the resulting images to your bot (as files). Make sure you have `k2pdfopt` and `pdftoppm` in your path.

## Instructions
Not necessarily in the correct order
* Install Windows XP and Office 2007 in the VM
* Install the IBM printer driver, and make it the default printer
* Embed the macro in Word by opening Word, pressing `Alt`+`F11` and pasting the code in a new script file.
* On Linux, install `pip`, and via that install `python-telegram-bot`, `numpy`, `emoji`, `htmlparser`, `python-docx`, `pillow`, `segno` and `tinydb`.
* Place `print_poller` and its content on `C:\`
* Mount the VirtualBox shared folder on `Z:\`
* Create the directories `Z:\telegram_bot\print`, `Z:\telegram_bot\queue` and `Z:\telegram_bot\pipe`
* Execute `C:\print_poller\print_contents.bat` when Windows starts (e.g. by placing a shortcut in `C:\Documents and Settings\Admin\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`).
* Place `suremark_tg_bot`, `ibmcallbacks.py` and `ibmprint.py` in `/opt/suremark_tg_bot`.
* Do `chmod 755 /opt/suremark_tg_bot/suremark_tg_bot`.
* Edit the `*.service` files to include your linux username and place them in `/etc/systemd/system` and enable them. The VM service is enabled with `sudo systemctl enable vboxvmservice@VM_UUID.service`. You can get this UUID with `VBoxManage list vms`.
* Edit `suremark_tg_bot` to point to your `.ini` file
* Use `setterm --blank `{`force` or `poke`}` --term linux </dev/tty1` to turn off the screen
* For unicode support it may be necessary to enable *Microsoft Scripting Runtime* in `Microsoft Visual Basic>Tools>References`
* Uncheck *Cable Connected* in Virtualbox settings>Network to isolate the VM
* For Emoji support, install an emoji font (such as Segoe UI Emoji, `seguiemj.ttf`). Make sure its name matches that in the `.ini`-file.
* Directly nuke the bot into sleep mode using ``` ssh host_machine "kill -USR2 \`pgrep suremark_tg_bot\`" ```
* Automatically convert anything into a qr code using the `\qr` command

## Tips
You can enable RDP for your Windows XP VM for easier administration.
1. Shut down your VMs
2. Install the required Virtualbox extension pack: `VBoxManage extpack install Oracle*.vbox-extpack`
3. Execute `VBoxManage modifyvm "Windows XP" --vrde on`
4. RDP in, e.g. by `xfreerdp /v:ADDRESS_OF_HOST`
5. Consider turning it off again for safety

## TODO
* Add automatic services. Printing reddit posts, weather.. Perhaps via RSS

## Installing Linux on the tablet
The Lamina tablet uses a cheap Atom-chipset that doesn't support the regular 64 bit EFI bootfiles.
This is the case for many of these no-name Chinese Windows tablets from the Windows 8 launch era.
Therefore, it is necessary to use a standalone GRUB IA32 EFI file to chainload the Linux installer.

See the Arch Wiki for details: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface#Booting_64-bit_kernel_on_32-bit_UEFI


## Notes
I don't own any rights to the IBM driver. Consider it abandonware.
Same goes for the Segoe Emoji font.
